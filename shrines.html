    <h3>What Are Japanese Shrines?</h3>
      <p>Japanese shrines, or jinja, are places of worship dedicated to Shinto deities. 
        They are characterized by their distinctive torii gates, sacred grounds, and 
        various ceremonial practices. Unlike temples, which are associated with Buddhism, 
        shrines are central to Shinto beliefs and rituals.</p>
